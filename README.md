# Learning about Transit Passenger Experience from Microblogging Posts
**Abstract:** Transit agencies often track delays and malfunctions but may overlook riders’ real-time social experiences. To fill this gap, we analyzed 559 tweets from 2020 to 2023, capturing personal accounts of public transportation use. Using thematic analysis, we found that 74% of posts criticized other passengers’ behavior, far outweighing comments on transit ride quality, such as complaints about delays (25%). Notably, 86% of tweets expressed negative sentiment, though some highlighted exceptional service. These findings demonstrate that interpersonal dynamics are a key contributor to riders’ experiences and illustrate the nature of the interactions that riders both like and dislike. 

**Dataset:** The attached dataset contains 559 anonymized tweets related to public transit experiences, collected between 2020 and 2023. Each record includes:
1). The anonymized tweet text
2). Timestamp of the original post (where available)
3). Longitude and Latitude of each tweet text

This dataset is suitable for research in NLP, sentiment analysis, social behavior, and urban mobility.
